Exploratory Data Analysis 

In contrast to my second project on data analysis, this project is a demonstration of not formal statistics but more of descriptive statistics which are used by businessmen to make more informed decisions. The entire data analysis process has been carried out inclusing- Data Wrangling, Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis. The data was cleaned keeping in mind the questions psed for investigation.

About the dataset: The dataset comprises details of over 10000 movies including budget, revenue, cast, genres and so on. Based on a few select features, trends were explored. For example, genres that have been most popular over the years and identifying feautures that have led to higher popularity of certain movies. Base on such analysis, a person who wants to create a movie can determine the key features that would lead to a higher popularity/ revenue.

This is, nonetheless, just one example of the great power of data science.
